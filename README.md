# AN-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-APPROACH-HEART-FAILURE-DETECTION
Heart failure or Congestive heart failure is a long term condition in which our heart canâ€™t pump 
blood well enough . Sometimes it leads to death of the patients. There are many factors like age,
anaemia, creatinine phosphokinase, ejection fraction, blood pressure etc. which helps to detect
heart failure earlier. Actually increasing heart failure rate leads to a major problem for medical
professionals. Using AI, we can easily overcome this problem. compared many machine learning model
to see their performance and pick up the best one.
## Summary
developed a robust predictive model that can extract patterns from data and detect
heart failure. The model was trained using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest neighbours, 
Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Adaptive Boosting.
## About the Dataset
There 299 rows and 13 columns in the dataset. Feature of the dataset are : 1) age,	
2) anaemia,	3) creatinine_phosphokinase,	4) diabetes,	5) ejection_fraction	
6) high_blood_pressure,	7)platelets,	8) serum_creatinine,	9) serum_sodium,
10) sex,	11) smoking,	12) time,	13) DEATH_EVENT.

## Conclusion
The ratio of heart failure patients is going to increase day by day. To overcome this dangerous 
situation, we develop a machine leaning model using comparative algorithm. Here we can see that 
Random Forest and Adaptive Boosting perform better than the other model. The dataset consists of
limited number of observations. This study can be used as a forecast tool for doctor and medical 
professionals to handle patients appropriately
